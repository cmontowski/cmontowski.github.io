			<h1>Spring Strolling</h1>
			<p>Feel the mud beneath your toes</p>
			<p>See the new life as it grows</p>
			<p>Feel the fresh and hopefilled air</p>
			<p>Stroll along without a care</p>
			<p>Feel the sun upon your skin</p>
			<p>Run and Romp and Jump and spin</p>
			<p>Feel the comimg opportunity</p>
			<p>To come and take a stroll with me</p>
			
			<h1>Spring Hiking</h1>
			<p>New life is coming. Everything is beginning to grow and nature is once again teeming with life.
			This is an excellent opportunity to get outside and spend some time exploring.
			Anything from a stroll along a bubbling stream filled with the icey runoff to a hike along a mountain ridge.</p>
			<p>Sometimes we get a little cooped up by the end of the winter and the fresh air
			can also remind us of fresh opportunities for the new year.</p>
