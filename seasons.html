			<h1>Take a hike</h1>
			<p>Take the time to Trek</p>
			<p>Take some time to check</p>
			<p>Take some time to listen</p>
			<p>Take some time to live</p>
			<p>Take the time to Walk</p>
			<p>Take some time to talk</p>
			<p>Take some time to see</p>
			<p>Take some time to seek</p>
			
			<h1>Why</h1>
			<p>Get outside! It isn't something we just do when the weather is nice.
			Everyday that we go outside is an opportunity to see something different,
			to see something beautiful.</p>
			<p>Sometimes we need to check ourselves to listen to live. 
			Sometimes we need to talk and sometimes we need to get outside so we can see.
			Sometimes we need to live an adventure to seek the extraordinary. And everyday,
			not just the warm sunny ones are opportunities for this.</p>
