			<p>Tramp along on the leaves</p>
			<p>Follow me into autumn</p>
			<p>through the musty woods</p>
			<p>Follow me into fall</p>
			<p>Tramp by the sleeping trees</p>

			<h1>Fall Hiking</h1>
			<p>Even though we often feel like fall is a time to refocus and dive back in to work
			the autumn colors and milder temperatures should encourage us to keep going outside and experiencing
			nature.</p>
			<p>Sometimes we need to go outside even while we are trying to refocus into school and work.
			Fall walks can give us an opportunity to reflect and experience nature preparing to take a long winter nap.</p>
