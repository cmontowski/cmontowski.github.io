				<h1>Camping in Tri-County Washington</h1>
				<p>This area is a fantastic place to go camping and there are hundreds of opporunities for it. From camping by Lake Roosevelt to a mountain stream, camping is almost never
				very crowded except on holiday weekends. I'm only going to discuss camping in designated areas but there are lots of places for camping off of backroads where sites have
				been developed. The best way to discover these is to simply go for a drive.</p>
				<p>Furthermore almost all of the lakes mentioned in the boating section have campgrounds along them even the smallest.Once again I'm only going to discuss a few of my
				favorites which if nothing else will hopefully give you a starting place to explore other locations. Almost all sites are open year round and are only closed due to weather.</p>
				<h3>Camping on Lake Roosevelt</h3>
				<h4>Kettle Falls Campground</h4>
				<p>The Kettle Falls Campground is located five minutes outside of the town of Kettle Falls and is directly next to a marina making it an excellent spot to camp and boat. This area
				is located near where the original town of Kettle Falls was located and walking around on the trails you can see old homesteads. There is a nearby day use area
				with pavillions and a playground. The camping itself is directly on the lake. The camping can be busy on the weekends. During the summer sites are 
				18$ a night and are 9$ a night in the off season.</p>
				<h4>Kamploops Island Campground</h4>
				<p>The Kamploops Island Campground is located just off of Lake Roosevelt and is a peninsula bordered on one side by Lake Roosevelt and on two sides by the Kettle River. The Kettle River is 
				warmer than Lake Roosevelt and wildlife is common. The sites are well developed but there is no running water. There is a small fishing dock. There are also nearby cliffs which are popular for cliff jumping but as
				a result are nearly always populated by teenagers. This is a fantastic spot if you want both the lake and a river. It is also not far off of local highways which gives it easy access. The prices are the same as for the Kettle
				Falls Campground</p>
				<h4>Marcus Island</h4>
				<p>The Marcus Island Campground is most notable in that is located near the old town of Marcus which can only be seen during spring and early summer due to fluctuating lake levels. Located further North on Lake Roosevelt
				it can be quieter. The sites are clean and many feature beautiful views of the lake. There is a boat dock located near the campground. Prices are the same as the Kettle Falls Campground.</p>
				<h3>Other Camping</h3>
				<h4>Boundary Dam Camp Area</h4>
				<p>The Boundary Dam Camp Area is located nearly on top of the Boundary Dam in the Pend Orielle. This location only has a few campspots but the rugged beauty of this area is stunning. Wildlife including bears is very common 
				in this area. The campground has full facilities and sits next to the boat dock giving easy acess to the Boundary Reservoir. There is a small beach next to the campground. The Pend Orielle is a wonderful place to explore and
				this can be a great jumping off point. The views of the reservoir from the campground are spectacular. The price is also unbeatble as it is free and due to a recent remodel facilities are up to date and clean.</p>
				<h4>Canyon Creek Campground</h4>
				<p>Located on Sherman Creek this campground is not along a lake. Activities here include a wheel chair access trail along the creek and huckleberry picking in late summer as well as playing in the creek itself. The creek itself can be great for hiking 
				or playing in. The campground is back in the forest and there are not any stunning views but the forest has its own type of beauty. The sites are all gravel and there are limited facilities, not including water or trash removal.
				This is great camping if you are looking for a more rustic experience. This campground is out of cell service and prices are $6 a night.</p>
				<h4>Curlew Lake Camping</h4>
				<p>Curlew Lake State Park includes a very well developed campground, including picnic areas and pavillions. This campsite has full facilities including showers and a no fee mooring dock. The campground is largelly grass covered and very picturesque.
				This campground has many sites. If you are interested in the <a href="culture.html">Stone Rose Quarry</a> this can be a great place to stay. <a href="https://parks.state.wa.us/166/Camping-fees" Target="_new">Rates<a> vary for different sites depending
				on desired facillities.</h4>
