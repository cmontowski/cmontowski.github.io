				<h1>Hiking in Tri-County Washington</h1>
				<img src="IMG_6292.JPG" class="imageleft">
				<p>Hiking is another area where the Tri-County area shines. Some of my favorite hikes are in the Kettle Crest range so there will be a special emphasis placed on these.
				Hiking can be an amazing way to spend an afternoon and all of these hikes reward with stunning views.</p>
				<h3>The Kettle Crest</h3>
				<p>44 miles in total hiking just a section can be a lot of fun. The Kettle Crest runs along some of the tallest peaks in the area. This hiking is generally fairly strenous due
				to the nature of the terrain. This range is lower than the cascades so instead of rugged peaks expect to see open fields filled with wild flowers and great views of the surrounding 
				valleys</p>
				<p>One of my favorite peaks to bag on the Kettle Crest trail is Columbia Mountain. This is just off of highway 20 and the top rewards you with a stunning view of the area and a rustic
				cabin that is used by backpackers</p>
				<h3>Mountain Climbing</h3>
				<h4>Abecrombie</h4>
				<p>Abecrombie the second highest peak in the area although by only a foot and is well worth the strenous 7.3 mile hike. It is located in Pend Orielle County and one of the only downsides is 
				varying road conditions. The view from the top showcases, Idaho, Canada, and of course a lot of Washington. There are old ruins from a manned ranger station that was 
				demolished in the 60s. The hike itself meanders through the forest to a saddle all the while climbing. The hike follows a few seperate trails so be sure to check you directions before starting.</p> 
				<h4>Sherman Peak</h4>
				<p>Sherman Peak is located just off of Sherman Pass where highway 20 cuts through the Kettle Crest. The loop that encircles it is 6 miles but you can easily cut off trail to get to the summit. The loop  
				hiking is fairly flat although the hike up to the loop can be strenous. This area burned in the 80s and so you have the opportunity to witness a new forest growing up among the old. The loop offers stunning
				views but even before the loop the trail cuts through an old forest and past a picteresque stream</p>
				<h3>Afternoon Strolls</h3>
				<h4>The Log Flume</h4>
				<p>The Log Flume is located off of Highway 20 and is a paved handicap accessible trail along Sherman Creek. This trail follows along the creek before finally crossing over near the end of the trail which ends at 
				<href="camping.html">Canyon Creek Campground</a> This hike isn't very long but its worth a visit and on hotter days you can forgo the trail and hike up the creek itself.</p>
				<h4>St. Pauls Mission</h4>
				<p>See <a href="culture.html">culture</a>
				<h3>Other hiking</h3>
				<img src="IMG_6507.JPG" class="image">
				<h4>Ferry County Rail Trail</h4>
				<p>Rails to Trails is located near Curlew WA in Ferry County and is an old train way that has been converted to a trail. The trail itself spans 25 miles but hiking a small section can be enjoyable. The best part
				about this trail is that it is almost completely flat. Some of the highlights are along <a href="boating.html">Curlew Lake</a> or a section near Curlew that goes through an old train tunnel. This trail is not paved
				but parts of it (8 miles in total) have been redone to become wheelchair accessible and effots are being made to further renovate the trail</p>
				<h4>Hoodoo Canyon</h4>
				<p>This trail is a bit further off of the beaten path but is a popular destination. This hike is 2.5 miles one way through the forest and along the ridge and finally down to Emerald Lake which is seasonal. For this reason
				this hike is best in early summer especially when many of the higher hikes still have a fair amount of snow. The hike itself has spectacular views of the canyon and the mountain ranges beyond. You can also access Emerald Lake
				from <a href="boating.html">Trout Lake</a> or to make the Hoodoo Canyon trail longer continue from Emerald Lake to Trout Lake. This hike can be slightly strenous and ticks are a problem in early summer but it's overall a great
				experience.</p>
