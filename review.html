	<h2>Best Web Host </h2>
		<p>After exstensively researching the three sites I would have to say that the best option for a web host.
		would be GoDaddy. All three offered comparable price range and 24/7 service.FatCow received awful reviews 
		online and offers only one plan.This makes it impossible to get a more detailed plan. This along with several
		complaints about fraudelent billing puts it in third place. A Small Orange had a decent plan and their online 
		reviews were comparable to GoDaddy. However, the slow and unreliable customer service is a definite negative. 
		Furthermore, while simplicity may be beneficial for those beginning to build websites it may not be the best 
		option for someone desiring a more in depth experience. </p>
		<p>Go Daddy takes the prize because of the websites researched it had the best user reviews, 
		the customer service was more reliable than the others, and it has reasonable prices offering
		a variety of sizes and shapes for hosting websites. It is also possible to test Go Daddy to
		make sure that it is what you are interested in before submitting credit card information. </p>
