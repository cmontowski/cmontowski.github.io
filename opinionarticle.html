		<p>There are billions of website on the internet. Many businesses have made the seamless transition to this medium creating elegant and well designed website. However, there are others that have struggled with this transition falling into pit holes or struggling to format cleanly. Websites such as, The Alpine Club of Canada’s website and The Library of Steven’s County website demonstrate the potential of the internet while Road Scholar’s driving school shows some of the struggles that may come with website building. </p>
		<p>The Alpine Club of Canada website is well designed and classy. The first noticeable trait is that the website has a well designed theme. They use white as the predominant color but background images to add some interest and green to add highlights. This color scheme works as the Alpine Club of Canada’s emblem is white, green, and grey.  There are only two fonts which helps to keep the page consistent looking. They use opacity at several points to allow the picture to have the greatest visibility and an overall minimalistic style. There is a menu at the top of page that is clear and understandable. Each navigation item when hovered over shows more options within the category available to click. The front page includes news and then headers for three of websites most important functions, membership, backcountry huts, and guided mountain adventures. The page loads quickly despite the several pictures on the website. The website adjusts for a mobile view. The code is clean and readable. JavaScript is used extensively. The website appears to be using HTML 5. Overall, this website is clean, readable, fast, intuitive, and pleasing to the eye. </p>
		<p>	A second website that is well designed is The Library of Stevens County’s website. This website is not minimalistic but maintains readability. The scholar scheme used is again white and green matching their emblem. The full margins of the page are used and it adjusts for a mobile view. The navigation tab is also coded to change based on a mobile or non-mobile view. The four most popular menu choices are listed at the top of the page along with the hamburger menu while in a nonmobile view however, as the site is shrunk three of the menu options condense into the hamburger menu leaving my account and the hamburger menu at the top. The hamburger menu once opened is understandable. There are several different font faces used on this site but each one is in a distinct area keeping a clean look. The news is listed at the top of the page and below it several options for various literary opportunities. No click here options are listed rather the icons for the various options are used to follow the link. These icons help to keep the library website modern and fun looking. The code is readable and HTML 5 is used. However, this website can have a slow load time. The Library of Steven’s County website although a much different design from the Alpine Club of Canada is another example of a well design and easily navigable website. </p>
		<p>A website that is not designed well is the Road Scholar Driving School Website. The website is able to be adjusted for a mobile view and the code is in HTML and is readable, however, the execution of the website is poorly done. They use a color scheme to match their emblem which is blue, white, and green. While they are consistent in their use of blue they use several different shades of white. Furthermore, their emblem which is on the upper left hand corner of their site is not centered within the image. The image that makes up the majority of their website does not stay within the margins of their wrap unless the site is shrunk. The background pattern does not work well with the color scheme. There are several different text fonts and sizes which do not work well together and are difficult to use. The department of license is given as a resource but it is not linked. Moving from the home page the page uses a burnt orange for some text and uses several different font-family’s on different pages. The Road Scholars driving school’s website is a demonstration of a website that is not well executed.</p>
