			<h1>Winter Walks</h1>
			<p>While it may be quite</p>
			<p>While the air is still</p>
			<p>Take a winter walk with me</p>
			<p>Breath the frosty air</p>
			<p>See the falling snow</p>
			<p>Feel the crunching beneath your feet</p>
			<p>Bundle up your fingertips</p>
			<p>And cover up your nose</p>
			
			<h1>Winter Hiking</h1>
			<p>It might be cold but the snow can be it's own kind of beauty.
			It can involve trees covered in their sparkling coats or the lakes and rivers
			filled with ice. There is a certain kind of stillness that only winter brings on. </p>
			<p>Sometimes we don't want to go outside in winter because it's cold,
			or because there's snow but this can just be an opportunity for different
			types of hiking. Maybe you just need snowshoes to make it happen</p>
