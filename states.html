					<div class="leftcol">
					<h3>Iowa</h3>
						<p>The Iowa state website is my favorite website. 
						The page layout is servicable although it is very indsutrial in appearance.
						The website loads very quickly and is easy to navigate. 
						Not only is the menu intuitive but there are quick links located on the homepage. 
						This site works well on multiple screen sizes adjusting for different views. The code appears to be clean and well written.</

					<h3>Tennessee</h3>
						<p>The Tennessee state website is my second favorite.
						The page layout is easy to understand and the slideshow at the top gives and idea of current events and opportunities in Tennessee. 
						This website also loads quickly and is easy to navigate although the quick links on the homepage are not as convenient as those on the Iowa state website. 
						This site adjusts for multiple screen sizes. The code from what I can tell is cleanly written.

					<h3>Vermont</h3>
						<p>The Vermont state website is next on my list. 
						The homepage is aesthetic, including pictures from around Vermont. 
						It is easy to find information about different opportunities and services offered. 
						However, the page loads slowly and the menu while practical is a little difficult to navigate. 
						The site adjusts for multiple screen sizes and the code is similar to that of the other sites.

					<h3>Oklahoma</h3>
						<p>The Oklahoma state website is near the bottom of my list. 
						The homepage is simple and somewhat difficult to understand although important information is listed at the top.
						The page loads at about the speed of the Vermont website but is difficult to navigate effectively.
						The site adjusts for multiple screen sizes and the code is clean with numerous comments. </p>

					<h3>Alaska</h3>
						<p>The Alaska state website is my least favorite website.
						The homepage is aesthetic and easy to navigate. 
						The site loads fast and the homepage has several helpful links. 
						The code appears to be clean although it is very simple. 
						The reason that this is my least favorite website is because it doesn't adjust for multiple screen sizes making it extremely difficult to navigate with a mobile device.
